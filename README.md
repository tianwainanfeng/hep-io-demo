# HEP I/O Demo — ROOT (TTree) · RNTuple · HDF5 · Phlex (adapter)

This repository contains small demo programs that illustrate read/write common HEP data formats:

- **ROOT TTree** (C++)
- **HDF5** (Python)
* a **Phlex-style adapter** that organizes data according to Phlex concepts (layers/cells/families) and persists to HDF5.

> **Note:** RNTuple support and CI/testing are planned but currently skipped.

## Details per example

### ROOT TTree (C++)

* `src/root_ttree/ttree_demo.cpp`
* Writes `data/ttree_demo.root` using standard `TTree` APIs.

### ROOT RNTuple (C++) (disabled now)

* `src/root_rntuple/rntuple_demo.cpp`
* Uses ROOT RNTuple API (requires recent ROOT). See ROOT RNTuple tutorials and examples. ([ROOT][1])

### HDF5 (Python)

* `src/hdf5_py/write_hdf5.py` and `read_hdf5.py`
* Demonstrates chunked & compressed datasets. See HDF Group docs for chunking and compression considerations. ([The HDF Group Support Site][2])

### Phlex-style adapter

* `src/phlex_example/phlex_writer.py`
* Illustrates Phlex layering concepts mapped to HDF5 groups/attributes. Phlex is documented conceptually (Phlex docs); this demo is an adapter/illustration, not an official Phlex SDK. ([framework-r-d.github.io][3])

## Notes about versions & compatibility

* **Phlex** currently has design docs and is still growing; this demo maps its design onto HDF5/ROOT backends for illustration. ([framework-r-d.github.io][3])
